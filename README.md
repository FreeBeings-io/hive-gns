## What is GNS?

GNS is a global notification system for dApps on the Hive Blockchain. It utilizes the HAF framework to retrieve and maintain relevant data sets from the Hive blockchain. It is completely open-source and any one can run a node to serve the notification system. The goal is to have multiple nodes running, giving multiple sources of truth.
